Color Ramps
-----------

GeoTrellis provides a set of color ramps (a list of colors) from which to choose. These are provided to ease the transition from developer to cartographer. However, you need not feel constrained by these and can use your own color palettes as well. There are many good resources online for selecting color ramps.
