What is *geotrellis*?
================

GeoTrellis is a high performance geoprocessing engine and programming toolkit. The goal of the project is to transform user interaction with geospatial data by bringing the power of geospatial analysis to real time, interactive web applications.

GeoTrellis was designed to solve three core problems, with a focus on raster processing:

- Creating scalable, high performance geoprocessing web services
- Creating distributed geoprocessing services that can act on large data sets
- Parallelizing geoprocessing operations to take full advantage of multi-core architecture

Features
--------

- GeoTrellis is designed to help a developer create simple, standard REST services that return the results of geoprocessing models.
- Like an RDBS that can optimize queries, GeoTrellis will automatically parallelize and optimize your geoprocessing models where possible.
- In the spirit of the object-functional style of Scala, it is easy to both create new operations and compose new operations with existing operations.
