geotrellis-site
===============

Documentation and site for GeoTrellis.

To run the site, just 'run' from within the 'site' subproject. You can use '~re-start' to restart the server as you update documentation. You can test the code within the docs by running 'test' in the 'docs' subproject.

Many thanks to [spray.io](http://spray.io) for the codebase, from which all of the implementation was derived.
